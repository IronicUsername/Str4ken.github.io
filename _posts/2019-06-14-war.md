War will come. War was, is and will always be part of our species. At least as long I will be living. So why not start war to be part of the people who decide what to fight for. We will fight for our home as always, the difference will be the definition of home. Home no longer must be nations. Home is our planet and our ecological system that provides what we as humans need to survive.

Right now there are powers that threaten our home, we know that and we feel it. But we seem to be paralyzed. Everyone is hoping that someone will fix this problem. But there is no someone. There is only us. But we seem to be caged in our behavior. The main problem is that our lives are the most comfortable we ever had. And everyone who achieved this comfortable life is hard to mobilize because we are lazy by nature. Most of us know that this comfortable life is not built on stable ground. Soon it will melt like the polar ice.
